= Demo: REST Services with Scala, Akka and Spray
:author: Tobias Roeser
:revdate: 2014-06-12

This project was live-coded at the https://www.xing.com/events/entwicklung-rest-services-scala-spray-akka-1403829["Entwicklung von REST-Services mit Scala, Spray und Akka" talk].

I added two changes after the talk, based on questions from the audience:

* The `SlowActor` now stops itself after it finished its work.
* The client shutdown is now handled in one `onComplete` handler instead of two, because the order in which multiple `onComplete` handlers run is undefined.

The slides of the talk: link:src/main/resources/Folie1.txt[Slide 1], link:src/main/resources/Folie2.txt[Slide 2], link:src/main/resources/Folie3.txt[Slide 3], link:src/main/resources/Folie4.txt[Slide 4], link:src/main/resources/Folie9.txt[Slide 5]
